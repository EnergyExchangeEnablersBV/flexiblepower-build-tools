This bundle contains a series of unit tests that, when ran together, form integration tests for the powermatcher
system. The tests can be ran all at once by running the IntegrationTestSuite. As of version 2.0, the tests take
roughly 70s to run.

The tests are located in the test folder so sonar can automatically detect and run them.
Please do not remove this readme from the src folder, the folder should not be empty.
