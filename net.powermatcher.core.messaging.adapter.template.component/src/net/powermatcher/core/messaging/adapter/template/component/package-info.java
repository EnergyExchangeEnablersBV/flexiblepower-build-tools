/**
 * The <code>net.powermatcher.core.messaging.adapter.template</code> and

 * for the <code>ExampleConnectorService</code> of the <code>net.powermatcher.core.agent.template</code> project.
 * These template projects serves as the starting point for developing a new Adapter for a PowerMatcher Agent, for
 * example for interfacing to a device. As an example, this template adapter uses a messaging connector
 * to interface with the outside world, and sends a message that it subscribes to itself.
